  <h3 class="card-title text-center">About Us</h3>
  <div>
    <p>We are a Minnesota based startup building business driven scheduling applications.</p>
    <p>Currently we are doing a beta test with A. Johnson & Sons Florist to build a 
    different kind of scheduling app. One that is paradoxically anachronistic in 
    that it caters to printed paper schedules, while being fully online ready. 
    This is because many small retail businesses want features like a fully printable 
    calandar filled with the information that they want, alongside a digital suite
    of features that makes scheduling easier such as cost projections.</p>
