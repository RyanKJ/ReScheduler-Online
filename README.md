# Schedule Hours

A hybrid offline and online retail scheduling application.

ScheduleHours is designed to function both as a printable calendar of employee schedules where the user has a large degree of control over the printed look and function as an online employee scheduling app where employees can see their schedules via their phones and computers. It achieves these contradictory objectives by utilizing a WYSIWYG calendar: A calendar prints exactly as it looks to the user. Because of this design choice, the user experience is extremely simple, allows retail managers to use printed schedule copies designed as they would like meanwhile leveraging the full online features one would expect from a web based retail employee scheduling application.
